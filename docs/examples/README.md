# Examples

This section contains concrete examples of CIMP applied to real changes.

Each example demonstrates:
- how Intent was defined
- how Scope was bounded
- how Constraints were identified
- how Execution was planned
- how outcomes were observed

## Available Examples

### Incident → Change Plan → Fix → Replay

A complete incident lifecycle showing how an incident led to a change plan, implementation, and data replay.

[View Example](./incident-to-replay.md)

### Risky Change with Explicit Constraints

A change that required careful constraint definition and risk mitigation.

[View Example](./risky-change-constraints.md)

### Post-Incident Remediation

How remediation was treated as a Change with explicit Intent and Scope.
