# CIMP

**CIMP (Change Intelligence Management Platform)** is a governance framework for designing, evaluating, and executing changes in complex systems.

CIMP sits between **intent** and **execution**.

It does not replace engineering practices, tools, or teams.  
It makes change **intentional, accountable, and observable**.

## What problem it solves

Modern systems fail not because of bad code, but because of **unmanaged change**.

Typical symptoms:

- changes are made without explicit intent
- risks are known but undocumented
- constraints exist only "in people's heads"
- incidents are investigated, but lessons are lost
- decisions disappear after the PR is merged

CIMP exists to address this gap.

It provides a **shared language and structure** for changes — before, during, and after they happen.

## What CIMP is

CIMP is:

- a **conceptual framework**
- a **set of governance principles**
- a **shared vocabulary** for change
- a **lifecycle model** for intent, execution, and incidents
- a way to preserve **architectural memory over time**

CIMP can be used:

- without AI
- without new tools
- without changing your tech stack

## What CIMP is not

CIMP is **not**:

- a CI/CD system
- a project management tool
- a ticketing system
- a code generator
- a replacement for engineering judgment

CIMP does not automate decisions.  
It makes decisions **explicit and traceable**.
